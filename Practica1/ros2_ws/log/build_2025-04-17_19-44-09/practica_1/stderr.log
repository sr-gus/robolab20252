[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlaunch.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "launch", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "launch" with any
  of the following names:

    launchConfig.cmake
    launch-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "launch" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "launch_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "launch"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
